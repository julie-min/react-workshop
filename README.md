## Learning React

- In React, a component is simply a function that returns renderable content.
- This is referred to as JSX.
- Once JSX is defined, custom components can be used in JSX code just like built-in HTML elements.


## How JSX Works

- JSX, with its tree-like structure, informs React about how components are related and what the UI should look like.
- It executes commands to manipulate the actual DOM.
- It serves the role of reflecting the target structure and code.
- Custom components can be used like HTML within JSX code.
